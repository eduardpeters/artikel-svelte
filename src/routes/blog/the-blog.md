# The Blog

This second entry of the **Artikel** posts relates to... the posts themselves!

I think it is a good idea, in general, to document your journey, be it technical, professional, personal... I think it is potentially valuable in a solo project setting to write down and reflect on the decisions being made, much like you would in a team setting.

I decided to keep a project short blog entry to help myself in the process of reflecting on what is going on in the project and learning from my mistakes in a transparent way.

The idea is to capture blog posts relating to particular milestones or interesting challenges that merit some highlighting. It can also function in a way as a sort of roadmap for the app, where perhaps in one blog post a decision is made about the direction of the next features to implement and use those as benchmarks for what actually made it to the outside world, understanding what was correctly assesed and what was not.

Overall, this should be short write ups to serve as documentation for the project and the growth it brings the author.
