# Artikel

Hey there, welcome to a series of short blogs explaining what this is all about.

I've been captivated by education for a while. Perhaps even longer than by programming. It makes me very happy to be able to help people by sharing knowledge and helping them attain it.

The idea behind **Artikel** is simple. Learning German can be a daunting experience. While there are many points on grammar we could focus on, I figured getting the nouns right would be a helpful point to start. Since getting the article right is half of the journey towards getting _Nominativ_, _Akkusativ_, _Dativ_ or _Genitiv_ right, for example.

Artikel should play out as a simple and intuitive game where you are presented with a noun and have to accurately select the corresponding article to earn points. A good point of start will be single runs of 10 or so words in sequence, scored and with feedback on what went right or wrong so you can do better. Down the road, I can picture more challenging or competitive avenues emerging. A few ideas include: timed runs, versus mode, leadersboards, challenges or achievements. There are plans to expand beyond article quizes and moving on to more complex scenarios, such as both article and _Kasus_.

I've been developing as a Full Stack developer for a while now and chose this as a nice next project, as I could find an interesting use case for joining a passion for software, education and simple games.

The chosen technologies are:

- Front End: **Svelte** (more accurately, SvelteKit)
- Back End: **NestJS**

Please join me in this journey and I really hope this can be of help to students.
